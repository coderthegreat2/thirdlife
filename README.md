just a simple server-sided fabric implementation of Grian's third life series so that you dont have to use spigot
THIS MOD IS INTENDED FOR SERVERS ONLY AND WILL NOT BAN PLAYERS IF USED IN SINGLEPLAYER
This mod is entirely server-sided and is not needed to join the modded server.
Requires fabric API to function properly.

# Functionality:
- Bans players who have died 3 times
- Sends a chat message to players after they die or join the server telling them how many lives they have remaining
- Adjusts name colors to show remaining lives (as done in Grian's original third life series)
- Includes commands for administrators to moderate the server.

# Commands:
/deaths \<player\>

prints player deaths, requires no permissions

/setdeaths \<player\> \<integer\>

sets a players deaths to a value, requires permission level of 2 (so operator)


the "difficult" branch also makes some elements of the game harder by making changes such as disabling netherite smithing template, removing blaze drops, making bookshelves not increase enchant table power, banning anvils maces and crystals, and some other stuff. it and also makes the end unreachable
