just a simple server-sided fabric implementation of grain's third life series so that you dont have to use paper

the "difficult" branch also makes some elements of the game harder by making changes such as disabling netherite smithing template, removing blaze drops, making bookshelves not increase enchant table power, banning anvils maces and crystals, and some other stuff. it and also makes the end unreachable
