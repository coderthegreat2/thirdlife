just a simple server-sided fabric implementation of Grian's third life series so that you dont have to use spigot.

THIS MOD IS INTENDED FOR SERVERS ONLY AND WILL NOT BAN PLAYERS IF USED IN SINGLEPLAYER

This mod is entirely server-sided and is not needed to join the modded server.

Requires fabric API to function properly.

# Functionality:
- Bans players who have died 3 times
- Sends a chat message to players after they die or join the server telling them how many lives they have remaining
- Adjusts name colors to show remaining lives (as done in Grian's original third life series)
- Includes 2 commands.

# Commands:
/lives

prints remaining player lives, requires no permissions

/setdeaths \<player\> \<integer\>

sets a players deaths to a value, requires permission level of 2 (or operator)
